Invited Talks
----

I have had the privilege of delivering speeches across various domains, such as digital technology, data science, finance, and education. My talks have reached audiences at prestigious institutions and professional associations across Australia, Indonesia, India, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, including the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, Financial Service Authority (OJK) Indonesia, Association of Certified Fraud Examiners Indonesia, CPA Australia Indonesia, University of Sussex, Anglia Ruskin University, Swinburne University of Technology, RMIT Vietnam, Singapore Institute of Technology, Pusan National University, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Binus University, BNI, and OCBC Indonesia. These talks have also featured significant conferences and platforms such as the QS Higher Ed Summit: Asia Pacific 2022, T20/G20 International Conference, and The Conversation Indonesia.

In these speeches, I discussed the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and the critical role of blockchain in finance, including cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. I also highlight the importance of data governance in the field of data science. Additionally, my involvement in educational workshops demonstrates my dedication to pedagogical innovation, particularly the development of teaching and business cases. My efforts aim to bridge geographical boundaries, reflecting on global engagement and commitment to advancing our digital future.
