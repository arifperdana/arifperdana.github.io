## Research Themes

My research programme is organised around two interconnected domains: **Digital Trust** and **Human-Centred Computing**. Together, these domains explain how technology reshapes decision-making, organisational practices, and societal systems, particularly in emerging economies and regulated environments.

### Digital Trust

My work in this domain examines how digital technologies influence trust, risk, and governance in financial systems. I study how emerging technologies, from distributed ledgers to machine learning, reconfigure the foundations of financial decision-making, regulation, and inclusion. Across multiple projects, I trace how technologies shape financial behaviour and organisational responsibilities. Studies on cryptocurrencies, crowdlending, and digital fraud uncover how social, cultural, technological, and economic cues shape trust and perceived legitimacy. These insights extend to analyses of blockchain in supply chains, digital financial inclusion models across Asia, and cross-country variation in trust toward digital assets.

A parallel strand investigates AI governance and central banking, offering models to assess algorithmic accountability, risk controls, and regulatory readiness. This includes work on algorithmic discrimination, AI-enabled audit processes, and regulatory frameworks for responsible digital finance. These contributions highlight how human judgement, data quality, and institutional design interact with automated systems. Collectively, this stream advances understanding of how digital trust is built, lost, and repaired within financial ecosystems, linking technology adoption to ethics, organisational governance, and the wider economic environment.

### Human-Centred Computing

My second research domain focuses on how individuals and organisations interact with algorithms, automation, and data-driven systems. I examine how technological design affects cognition, learning, work practices, and user experience, particularly in contexts where digital systems reshape daily routines. Early work on interactive data visualisation and XBRL explored how information presentation influences judgement and decision quality. This has evolved into broader investigations of human–algorithm collaboration, including robotic process automation in accounting, digital device use among seniors, and voice assistant adoption in workplace settings.

In education, my studies look at data-driven learning, technology-supported pedagogy, and the use of generative AI for cognitive and ethical development. These projects explore how systems are adopted, how users make sense of automation, and how digital tools shape learning outcomes. I also engage with design questions at the ecosystem level: what makes digital services inclusive, what capabilities organisations need to integrate analytics, and how cultural contexts influence the reception of AI technologies. These studies are grounded in real-world deployments in small firms, government agencies, and community environments. Through this stream, I contribute to human-centred computing by connecting system design to human cognition, organisational readiness, and the social conditions under which technology becomes meaningful.

### Integrative Contribution

Positioning these two streams together, my research shows how trust, ethics, information quality, and human judgement remain central, even as financial systems and work processes become increasingly automated. Whether the context is decentralised finance, digital inclusion initiatives, or AI-supported auditing, my work highlights that technology succeeds when it is trusted, understandable, and situated within human capabilities and institutional structures.

Across both domains, my publications in journals such as *Information & Management*, *Technology in Society*, *Telematics and Informatics*, *International Journal of Accounting Information Systems*, *Electronic Markets*, and *Production Planning & Control* reflect a consistent focus on the interaction between technological innovation and human decision-making.

### Case Studies

Alongside academic publications, I have developed a strong portfolio of business cases that bring digital transformation challenges to life for students and practitioners. These cases, published mainly in the *Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases* and related outlets in book chapters, combine storytelling with rigorous analysis to illuminate real-world dilemmas at the intersection of business, technology, and society.

My cases span diverse industries and themes, including:
- Digital transformation in government and healthcare (GovTech Singapore, SingHealth)
- Financial innovation and inclusion (HesabPay in Afghanistan, Aurora Crowdlending, bKash, Kasikornbank)
- Cybersecurity threats and data governance (Lazarus Group, TruMe Life)
- Sustainability and responsible technology use (Haidilao)
- Strategic adaptability in digital platforms (ByteDance, Zalora, online travel agencies)

These cases not only support classroom learning but also provide insights for executives navigating the complexity of digital disruption.

### Ongoing Work

My current projects extend these trajectories into new directions:
- **ESG and sustainability**: Evaluating ESG performance through GRI frameworks and data analytics, exploring paradoxes in ESG investment returns, and analyzing how technologies accelerate ESG adoption.
- **Trust, ethics, and AI**: Investigating algorithmic trust in central banking, ethical challenges in AI adoption for accounting and finance, and responsible governance in automated decision-making systems.
- **Digital finance and inclusion**: Studying fintech adoption among underserved communities, behavioral shifts due to BNPL services, and machine learning approaches to credit scoring in crowdlending.
- **Human–algorithm collaboration**: Assessing how generative AI reshapes accountants' skills, decision-making, and ethical practices, while exploring broader questions of human–machine augmentation in knowledge work.
- **Healthcare and data governance**: Analyzing privacy concerns in health data sharing and the role of AI in pharmacovigilance across the Asia-Pacific.

These ongoing studies reflect a commitment to understanding how digital technologies reshape industries, transform professional practices, and influence societal outcomes, while remaining attentive to governance, trust, and ethics.
