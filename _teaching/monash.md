I am an Associate Professor for Data Science Programme at Monash University, from 2021 to Present.

Courses Taught
======

At Monash University, I am teaching postgraduate courses as follows:

* **Introduction to Database**: This unit will introduce the concept of data management in an organisation through relational database technology. The theoretical foundation of the relational model, analysis and design, and implementation of a relational database using SQL will be covered.
* **Computer Architecture and Networks**: This unit will introduce students to the fundamentals of computer systems, focusing on modern operating systems and networking technology. It covers CPU, memory, storage and peripherals; Operating System basics; TCP/IP layered protocols; WAN and LAN networking fundamentals; internetworking and transport protocols; and primary computer and network security concepts.
* **Data exploration and visualisation**: This unit introduces statistical and visualisation techniques for the exploratory analysis of data. It covers the role of data visualisation in data science and its limitations. Visualisation of qualitative, quantitative, temporal and spatial data is presented. What makes an effective data visualisation, interactive data visualisation, and creating data visualisations with R and other tools is also given.
* **Algorithms and  Programming Foundations in Python**: The course includes topics in statistical and exploratory analysis, data formats and languages, processing of massive data sets, management of data and its role and impact in an organisation and society. Students will be able to apply their learning, knowledge and skills as part of the assessment process and have the opportunity to complete either a research project or an industry experience studio project.
* **Applied Data Analysis** This unit aims to provide students with the necessary analytical and data modelling skills for the roles of a data scientist or business analyst. Students will be introduced to established and contemporary Machine Learning techniques for data analysis and presentation using widely available analysis software. They will look at several characteristic problems/data sets and analyse them with appropriate machine learning and statistical algorithms. Those algorithms include regression, classification, clustering and so on. The unit focuses on understanding analytical problems, machine learning models, and basic modelling theory. Students will need to interpret the results and the suitability of the algorithms.
